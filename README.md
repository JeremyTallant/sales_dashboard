# Online Retail Sales Dashboard in Excel
## Project Overview 
This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis and visualization of an online retail sales dataset. The dataset includes transactions from December 1, 2010, to December 9, 2011, for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail company. Specializing in unique all-occasion gifts, the company's client base is predominantly wholesalers. A key part of this analysis involves creating an interactive dashboard to visualize key metrics and effectively communicate insights.
## Data Source
This dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
